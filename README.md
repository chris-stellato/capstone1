## Proposal 1: 
### Colorado Avalanche Information Center Data

https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1j4-5IKizg1dZ7N1honszrvymsNvKPPOAX8ltxLaXK58/edit?usp=sharing

#### Dataset
This dataset contains records of avalanche-related fatalities from 1951 through 2020. It contains several interesting data points for each incident, including: 
* location
* date of occurrance
* mode of travel (skis, snowshoes, snowmobile, etc)
* number of fatalities per incident
* magnitude of burial and incident details (only for more recent years. 

#### Possible Visualizations
* Heat map of avalanche fatalities by location
* histogram of fatalities by method of travel or by location
* probability of fatality incident by month, showing months with highest probability for fatal incidents

#### Possible Hypotheses to test: 
* "Traveling by X method is the most dangerous method when considering avalanche fatalities"
* "Choosing to recreate during X month increases the probability of an avalanche fatality incident by Y% vs. Z month
* "Due to regional snowpack characteristics and local demographics, X state is the most dangerous state to be a backcountry traveler"
